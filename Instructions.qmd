# ImputeREEapp

This is a companion app in development for the [imputeREE package for
R](https://github.com/cicarrascog/imputeREE). It allows the imputation
of missing REE data and calculates Ce and Eu anomalies on magmatic
zircon based on the Chondrite-Onuma and Chondrite-Lattice methods of
[Carrasco-Godoy and Campbell
(2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00410-023-02025-9)
and the logarithmic regression from [Zhong et al.
(2019)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00710-019-00682-y).

At the top, it is possible to access the different sections of the app.
A general description of each section is included here.
