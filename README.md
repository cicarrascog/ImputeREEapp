This is a companion app to the [imputeREE package for
R](https://github.com/cicarrascog/imputeREE). It allows the imputation
of missing REE data and calculate Ce and Eu anomalies on zircon based on
an empirical method derived from lattice strain theory of [Blundy and
Wood (1994)](https://www.nature.com/articles/372452a0).

The app is temporary hosted in shinyapp.io, which has usage limits. It
is planned to move this App to a more stable server.

If you want to use this app from your computer, you can clone this
repository. You'll need to download R, Rstudio and install the necesaty
packages.
