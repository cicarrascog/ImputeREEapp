# ImputeREEapp

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a companion app ïn development for the [imputeREE package for
R](https://github.com/cicarrascog/imputeREE). It allows the imputation
of missing REE data and calculate Ce and Eu anomalies on magmatic zircon
based on the Chondrite-Onuma and Chondrite-Lattice methods of
[Carrasco-Godoy and Campbell
(2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00410-023-02025-9)
and the logarithmic regression from [Zhong et al.
(2019)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00710-019-00682-y).

The app is temporary hosted in shinyapp.io, which has usage limits. It
is planned to move this App to a more stable server.

The current version at shinyapp.io only allows to use the
Chondrite-Lattice Method. You can access to the app using this
[link](https://ccarr.shinyapps.io/ImputeREEapp).

If you want to use this app from your computer, you can clone this
repository. You’ll need to download R, Rstudio and install the necesary
packages.
