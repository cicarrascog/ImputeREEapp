### Important

The coefficient of determination of each model gives an idea of how well
the model fits the data. However, it is important to consider that R^2^
values will be higher for the Chondrite-Onuma, which is based on
quadratic regression, than for the Chondrite-Lattice method.

For the Chondrite-Onuma, the parameter `a (parabola)` can be as an
additional measure of confidence. Zircon REE patterns are not upward
concave.
